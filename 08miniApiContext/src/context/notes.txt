context api is used for state management 
not for more big project
in large project -> we use redux ,like state management library

import React from 'react'
const UserContext = React.createContext();
//createContext is a method to create context
export default UserContext;

//we use wrapper -> fragments
<UserContext>
 //here we can return may things
</UserContext>

when we make contextProvider -> we have to make jsx file , as we make fragments , so jsx required
